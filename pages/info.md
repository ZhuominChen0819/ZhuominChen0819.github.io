Since years I am studying physical oceanography, I love to work with researchers with diverse backgrounds and research experience and learn from others.
Currently I am working with groups of scientists in physical, biogeochemical, and ecological oceanography and climate. As an early-career scientist, I'd love to connect with more scientists who're interested in the coastal oceans.





Yours sincerelly, Zhuomin
