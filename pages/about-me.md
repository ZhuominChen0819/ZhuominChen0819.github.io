### My research interests include:
* Coastal ocean processes, including marine extremes and oceanic eddies (e.g., Gulf Stream eddies); 
* Linkages between coastal ocean and large-scale climate and ocean processes (e.g., the Gulf Stream);
* Seasonal-to-decadal prediction and predictability of driver variables relevant to marine ecosystems;
* Climate impacts on habitat shifts of diverse marine species (e.g., economically important fisheries).

### My Education and Research Experience
#### 2021-now:  Research Scientist in Physical & Biogeochemical Oceanography
* <i><b>University of Connecticut (UConn)</b></i>, Groton, CT   
* I am currently working with [Dr. Samantha Siedlecki][9], [Dr. Matthew Long (NCAR)][10], and [Dr. Colleen Petrick (Scripps)][11] at the [*Coastal Biogeochemistry Dynamics Lab, UConn*][12] to understand decadal predictability of oxygen and ocean metabolic state relevant to fisheries in large marine ecosystems of the ocean.

#### 2018-2021: Guest Student/Postdoc Fellow/Postdoc Investigator in Physical Oceanography
* <i><b>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)</b></i>, Woods Hole, MA   
* I was awarded a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship (2018-2020) while working with [Dr. Young-Oh Kwon][4], [Dr. Ke Chen][5], [Dr. Paula Fratantoni (NOAA NMFS)][6], [Dr. Glen Gawarkiewicz][7], and [Dr. Terrence Joyce][8] about developing and evaluating a statistical forecasting system for oceanographic conditions and living marine resources over the Northeast U.S. Shelf.

#### 2013-2018: Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Physical Oceanography
* <i><b>Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey</b></i>, New Brunswick, NJ   
* I was trained as a coastal physical oceanographer through my PhD study with [Dr. Enrique Curchitser][1] at the [*Earth System Modeling Lab, Rutgers*] [2]. I investigated the [Dynamics and Spatio-temporal Variability of the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool][3], as well as its potential connections with the meridional fluctuations of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Oscillation. 
          
#### 2009-2013: Bachelor of Science (B.S.) with honors in Marine Science
* <i><b>Ocean University of China</b></i>, Qingdao, China
* My undergraduate project is to investigate the impacts of the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge on the tidal dynamics of the Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao, China, using a high-resolution FVCOM model.
