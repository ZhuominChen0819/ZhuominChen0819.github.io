#### **Research Interests:**
* Coastal ocean processes, including marine extremes;   
* Linkage between coastal ocean and large-scale climate /ocean processes;   
* Seasonal-to-decadal prediction and predictability of coastal physical and biogeochemical driver variables relevant to marine ecosystems.   

#### **Ongoing Projects:**
1. Decadal Predictability of Ocean Metabolic State   
:   I am currently working on investigating <i>interannual to decadal predictability of ocean metabolic state</i> in large marine ecosystems around the North America, using a novel suite of initialized retrospective Earth System Model with embedded ocean biogeochemistry (CESM-DPLE). This study also identifies mechanistic controls to the predictability from the physical and biogeochemical driver variables across different marine species.   
2. Tracking Source Waters for the Northeast U.S. Shelf (NES) Bottom waters   
:    I am also working on tracking source waters of the NES bottom waters based on water mass characteristics, using a reanalysis dataset. This study also investigates relationships with Gulf Stream warm core rings.
