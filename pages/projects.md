#### **Latest Progresses & News:**
Upcoming February, 2024
: * I am going to give a guest presentation about marine habitat shifts predictions in the <i><b>Transatlantic High-latitude Oceanography Retreat (THOR) 2024</b></i>.
  * I am going to present a poster about marine habitat shifts predictions at the <i><b>Ocean Sciences Meeting 2024</b></i>.

January, 2024
: * My first-author paper titled "Skillful Multiyear Prediction of Marine Habitat Shifts Jointly Constrained by Ocean Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen" has just been accepted for publication in <i>Nature Communications</i>. Here is a preprint of the [work][1].

December, 2023
: * I gave an online seminar (30-min) at the <i><b>2023 U.S. Northeast Climate-Fisheries Seminar Series</b></i> about our recent work on marine habitat shifts predictions.

November, 2023
: * A research proposal (Lead PI: <b>Z. Chen</b>) has been submitted to the NOAA MAPP program about project future changes in the Gulf Stream warm-core rings and the corresponding impacts on the Northeast U.S. continental shelf.

October, 2023
: * I gave an oral presentation (20-min) about marine habitat shift predictions at the <i><b>PICES-2023 Annual Meeting</b></i>, Seattle, WA.

September, 2023
: * I gave an oral presentation (20-min) about marine habitat shift predictions at the <i><b>Eastern Pacific Ocean Conference</b></i>, Stanford Sierra Conference Center, Reno, NV
  * Our letter of intent (LOI) for a proposal submitted to the NOAA MAPP program has been approved.

August, 2023
: * We submitted a letter of intent (LOI) for a research proposal (Lead PI: <b>Z. Chen</b>) to the NOAA MAPP program.

July, 2023
: * Constructive comments received from reviewers on our recently submitted paper to <i><b>Nature Communications</b></i>.

June, 2023

#### **Ongoing Projects:**
1. Marine habitat shifts jointly constrained by ocean temperature and dissolved oxygen  
:  I am currently working on investigating <i>marine habitat shifts</i> in large marine ecosystems around the North America, using a novel suite of initialized retrospective Earth System Model with embedded ocean biogeochemistry (CESM-DPLE). This study also identifies mechanistic controls to the predictability from the physical and biogeochemical driver variables across different marine species.   
2. Future changes in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool
:  I am also working on investigating future changes in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool, using dynamically downscaled high-resolution models under high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5.
3. Future projections in the Gulf Stream Warm-Core Rings
:  I am also working on investigating projections of changes in the Gulf Stream Warm-Core Rings using dynamically downscaled high-resolution models under high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5.
4. Tracking Source Waters for the Northeast U.S. Shelf (NES) Bottom waters   
:  I am also working on tracking source waters of the NES bottom waters based on water mass characteristics, using a reanalysis dataset. This study also investigates relationships with Gulf Stream warm core rings.
