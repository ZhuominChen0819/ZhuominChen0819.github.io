#### **Research Interests:**
* Coastal ocean processes, including marine extremes and oceanic eddies (e.g., Gulf Stream eddies) 
* Linkages between coastal ocean and large-scale climate and ocean processes (e.g., the Gulf Stream)
* Seasonal-to-decadal prediction and predictability of coastal physical and biogeochemical driver variables relevant to marine ecosystems.   

#### **Ongoing Projects:**
1. Marine habitat shifts jointly constrained by ocean temperature and dissolved oxygen  
:  I am currently working on investigating <i>marine habitat shifts</i> in large marine ecosystems around the North America, using a novel suite of initialized retrospective Earth System Model with embedded ocean biogeochemistry (CESM-DPLE). This study also identifies mechanistic controls to the predictability from the physical and biogeochemical driver variables across different marine species.   
2. Future changes in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool
:  I am also working on investigating future changes in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool, using dynamically downscaled high-resolution models under high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5.
3. Future projections in the Gulf Stream Warm-Core Rings
:  I am also working on investigating projections of changes in the Gulf Stream Warm-Core Rings using dynamically downscaled high-resolution models under high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5.
4. Tracking Source Waters for the Northeast U.S. Shelf (NES) Bottom waters   
:  I am also working on tracking source waters of the NES bottom waters based on water mass characteristics, using a reanalysis dataset. This study also investigates relationships with Gulf Stream warm core rings.
