#### **Latest Progresses & News:**
February, 2024
: * I am going to present a poster about [marine habitat shifts predictions][4] at the <i><b>Ocean Sciences Meeting 2024</b></i> (Thursday 4:00-6:00 PM, Feb 22nd, 2024; Poster Hall, First Floor). I will be there in person only from Wednesday evening to Friday afternoon due to teaching. Happy to meet people there in person! 
: * <b><i>UConn Today</i></b> reported our work about predicting marine habitat shifts, titled "[A New Tool to Skillfully Predict Marine Habitat Shiftsi][5]".

January, 2024
: * My first-author paper titled [<b><i>"Skillful Multiyear Prediction of Marine Habitat Shifts Jointly Constrained by Ocean Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen"</i></b>][1] has just been published at <i><b>Nature Communications</b></i>, together with [an excellent commentary][6] by Dr. Mark R. Payne. 
  * I am currently <b>co-teaching</b> the course [<i><b>MARN3002 Foundations of Marine Sciences</b></i>][3] with [<i><b>Prof. Hans Dam</b></i>][2] in the Spring semester, 2024.

December, 2023
: * I gave an online seminar (30-min) at the <i><b>2023 U.S. Northeast Climate-Fisheries Seminar Series</b></i> about our recent work on marine habitat shifts predictions.

November, 2023
: * A research proposal (Lead PI: <b>Z. Chen</b>) has been submitted to the NOAA MAPP program about project future changes in the Gulf Stream warm-core rings and the corresponding impacts on the Northeast U.S. continental shelf.

October, 2023
: * I gave an oral presentation (20-min) about marine habitat shift predictions at the <i><b>PICES-2023 Annual Meeting</b></i>, Seattle, WA.

September, 2023
: * I gave an oral presentation (20-min) about marine habitat shift predictions at the <i><b>Eastern Pacific Ocean Conference</b></i>, Stanford Sierra Conference Center, Reno, NV
  * Our letter of intent (LOI) for a proposal submitted to the NOAA MAPP program has been approved.

August, 2023
: * We submitted a letter of intent (LOI) for a research proposal (Lead PI: <b>Z. Chen</b>) to the NOAA MAPP program.

July, 2023
: * Constructive comments received from reviewers on our recently submitted paper to <i><b>Nature Communications</b></i>.

June, 2023
: * I presented a poster (30-sec poster preview talk) about marine habitat shift predictions at the <i><b>Gordon Research Conference-Coastal Ocean Dynamics</b></i>, Bryant University, RI 

#### **Ongoing Projects:**
1. Marine habitat shifts jointly constrained by ocean temperature and dissolved oxygen  
:  I am currently working on investigating <i>marine habitat shifts</i> in large marine ecosystems around the North America, using a novel suite of initialized retrospective Earth System Model with embedded ocean biogeochemistry (CESM-DPLE). This study also identifies mechanistic controls to the predictability from the physical and biogeochemical driver variables across different marine species.   
2. Future changes in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool
:  I am also working on investigating future changes in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Cold Pool, using dynamically downscaled high-resolution models under high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5.
3. Future projections in the Gulf Stream Warm-Core Rings
:  I am also working on investigating projections of changes in the Gulf Stream Warm-Core Rings using dynamically downscaled high-resolution models under high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5.
4. Tracking Source Waters for the Northeast U.S. Shelf (NES) Bottom waters   
:  I am also working on tracking source waters of the NES bottom waters based on water mass characteristics, using a reanalysis dataset. This study also investigates relationships with Gulf Stream warm core rings.
