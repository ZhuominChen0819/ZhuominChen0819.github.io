We will use dynamically downscaled regional MOM6 simulations to investigate future changes in the generation, propagation and shelf interaction of Gulf Stream warm-core rings, evaluate the corresponding physical and biogeochemical changes and impacts on the shelf, and understand the underlying mechanisms. Our objectives include: (1) assess the historical run of the regional MOM6 model for its WCR reproductive capacity; (2) project future changes in GS WCRs and the corresponding physical and biogeochemical changes on the shelf, based on existing eddy identification and tracking techniques; (3) clarify the dynamical basis for the projected changes in the WCRs and understand the underlying mechanisms by examining eddy energetics and diagnostic budgets of heat, salt, oxygen, and nutrients; and (4) critically assess and discuss potential climate change impacts on the living marine resources with a focus on fisheries (e.g., future habitat shifts) influenced by the projected WCR changes and deliver this information to NOAA NMFS and CEFI partners.
