# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Title of your website
title: 'Zhuomin Chen, Ph.D.'

# The slogan describes your website and is used on homepage in <title> and other important places
slogan: 'Coastal Oceanographer'

# The description is used on homepage and in the footer to quickly describe your website. Use a maximum of 150 characters for SEO-purposes.
description: 'This is a personal webpage for Dr. Zhuomin Chen and her research work in Coastal Oceanography.'

# The credits show up in the includes/_footer.html – It would be nice of you to leave a link to Phlow or Feeling Responsive as a thank you :)
